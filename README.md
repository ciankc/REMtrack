## REMtrack - REM Sleep Tracker

### Introduction

Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is the final stage in the sleep cycle. Your brain becomes more active and stores long-term memories. The National Sleep Foundation states that REM sleep benefits learning, memory, and mood, and that a lack of it has adverse physical and emotional effects. Characteristic features of REM sleep include eye movements and paralysis of the arm and leg muscles. 

### Problem Statement

Current at-home sleep trackers use movement and heartrate as the primary indicators of sleep cycles. However, these are not accurate indicators of REM sleep. During a polysomnogram (sleep study), brain waves (EEG) and eye movements (EOG) are monitored to determine REM sleep. Sleep studies are expensive and impractical for a user that simply wants more information regarding their sleep cycles, or someone that wishes to track their sleep over time. 

The REMtrack solution involves a sleep mask with an integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU), as well as a MyoWare muscle sensor to detect when muscle tone is lost during REM sleep. These sensors will prevent the need for costly sleep studies, reduce the inaccuracies of at-home sleep tracking, and be cheaper and more comfortable than existing EEG headsets. 

### Prior Works

Recently, companies have begun to incorporate EEG monitoring into headbands in order to track sleep and meditative states. Muse and Dreem have each created solutions that are meant to inform users about their sleep patterns, including REM sleep. Unfortunately, these headbands are bulky and expensive (around $500), and are not a viable solution for all patients. Dreem has validated their hardware with research that indicates their device is as accurate as a polysomnogram, and the goal of REMtrack is to meet that same standard, with purely the IMU and muscle sensor.
