## REMtrack - REM Sleep Tracker

### Introduction

Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is the final stage in the sleep cycle. Your brain becomes more active and stores long-term memories. The National Sleep Foundation states that REM sleep benefits learning, memory, and mood, and that a lack of it has adverse physical and emotional effects. Characteristic features of REM sleep include eye movements and paralysis of the arm and leg muscles. 

### Problem Statement

Current at-home sleep trackers use movement (actigraphy) as the primary indicator of sleep cycles. However, this is based on the "assumption that people move most during wake states with a progressive reduction in motion as they approach the deepest stages of sleep" (1). This is an inaccurate way to classify REM sleep cycles. During a polysomnogram (sleep study), brain waves (EEG) and eye movements (EOG) are monitored to determine REM sleep. Sleep studies are expensive and impractical for a user that simply wants more information regarding their sleep cycles, or someone that wishes to track their sleep over time. 

### Approach

The REMtrack solution involves a sleep mask with an integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU), as well as a pulse sensor. Heart rate has been shown to have "clear long-range correlations during REM sleep (H=0.78)", which means that it will be a useful tool to measure (2). These sensors will prevent the need for costly sleep studies, reduce the inaccuracies of at-home sleep tracking, and be cheaper and more comfortable than existing EEG headsets. 

### Prior Works

Recently, companies have begun to incorporate EEG monitoring into headbands in order to track sleep and meditative states. Muse and Dreem have each created solutions that are meant to inform users about their sleep patterns, including REM sleep. Unfortunately, these headbands are bulky and expensive (around $500), and are not a viable solution for all patients. Dreem has validated their hardware with research that indicates their device is as accurate as a polysomnogram, and the goal of REMtrack is to meet that same standard, with purely the IMU and pulse sensor.

### Methodology

#### Assembly
A sparkfun IMU [MPU-9250](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13762) will be connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero via an I2C interface. This IMU will rest on a sleep mask that tightly rests on the user's eyelids to sense movement. Additionally, the [heart rate sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574) will be connected to an Intel Edison board through an analog input. These two embedded devices will stream data to an Azure IoT server using MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT). This data will be stored so that it can be used for training.

#### Datasets
The raw data can be viewed at the following [DropBox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2fkjsiwpo1naz6q/AABdRBSJ_QOWfcs7xz8bPXx7a?dl=0). Pulse data will be averaged over a period of 60 seconds to reduce overhead. IMU data will be filtered to account for head movements and other large motions. During rapid eye movement, the IMU data will be interpreted and flagged in the dataset. IMU motion data will also be logged each 60 seconds, which will be calculated as the offset of accelerometer and gyroscope data. Depending on the results of stand-alone eye movement tests, these metrics may be adjusted to better reflect the realities of REM sleep. 

#### Labeled Data/Ground Truth
The iPhone application Muse Direct will be used to gain access to the raw EEG data. Data will be streamed to the Muse Direct cloud where it will be downloaded in a human-readable format and labeled. We will be looking for alpha, delta, and theta waves (in that order) which will then lead to the beginning of REM sleep -- a pattern with â€œsaw tooth waves" that are low voltage, random, and fast (3). The labeled data will be used in conjuction with the IMU and pulse data on the Azure IoT server to correctly label different stages of sleep and provide the basis for supervised learning.

#### Learning Models
The raw labeled data from the IMU and pulse sensor will be used to train multivariate multi-step time series forecasting models. A likely candidate for a model is the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network which is often used for processing sequences of data. LSTM units can be trained in a supervised fashion using an optimization algorithm, combined with backpropagation through time. 

#### Experimental Validation and Success Metrics
After gathering enough training data and correctly labeling it with the Muse device, we aim to create a machine learning model that will be able to correctly classify REM sleep given solely the IMU and pulse sensor inputs. An accuracy of greater than 90% within a window of 2-3 minutes will be considered a successful project. Stretch goals include providing sleep insights from the data and possible recommendations regarding sleep and waking times.
